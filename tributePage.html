		  	<p>Grace Murray Hopper, a pioneer in computer technology, was born in New York City in December 1906.  She attended Vassar College, graduating in 1928 with a B.A. in Mathematics.  Then she received a PhD in Mathematics from Yale University in 1934.  In 1930 she married Vincent Foster Hopper, who died in 1945 during World War II.  While earning her PhD, Hopper taught math at Vassar starting in 1931 and she continued teaching there until 1943.</p>
			<p>In 1943, Hopper resigned her position at Vassar to join the Navy WAVES (Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service).  In 1944, she was commissioned as a Lieutenant (Junior Grade), and she was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University.  Her team worked on and produced the Mark I, an early prototype of the electronic computer.  Hopper wrote a 500-page Manual of Operations for the Automatic Sequence-Controlled Calculator in which she outlined the fundamental operating principles of computing machines.  Additionally, while working on the Mark I, Hopper coined the word “bug” to describe a computer malfunction.</p>
			<p>After the end of the war, Hopper became a research fellow on the Harvard faculty and in 1949, joined the Eckert-Mauchly Corporation, continuing her pioneering work on computer technology.  Hopper was involved in the creation of UNIVAC, the first all-electronic digital computer.  She invented the first computer compiler, a program that translates written instructions into codes that computers read directly.  This work led her to co-develop the COBOL, one of the earliest standardized computer languages.  COBOL enabled computers to respond to words in addition to numbers.   Hopper also lectured widely on computers, giving up to 300 lectures per year.  She predicted that computers would one day be small enough to fit on a desk and people who were not professional programmers would use them in their every day life.</p>
 			<p>During her career, she retained her affiliation with the Naval Reserve.  By 1966, she attained the rank of Commander.  The following year in 1967, Commander Hopper was called back to active duty and she was assigned to the Chief of Naval Operations’ staff as Director, Navy Programming Languages Group.  In 1973, she was promoted to Captain, to Commodore in 1983, and to Rear Admiral in 1985.  Hopper remained active in industry and academia until her death in 1992.</p> 
			<p>USS Hopper (DDG-70) was named in honor of Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper and she was buried with full Naval honors at Arlington National Cemetery on January 7, 1992.</p>

			<h2><strong>Major Awards And Achievments:</strong></h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Grace led the team which invented <strong>COBOL</strong> or Common-Business Oriented Language, one of the user-friendly computer software programs which can be used for business purpose. Though she did not invent the language, she definitely encouraged its adaptation.</li>
				<li>In 1969, Grace was awarded the first <strong>‘Computer Science Man-of-the-Year Award’</strong> from ‘Data Processing Management Association’.</li>
				<li>In 1973, she was the first woman and the first US citizen to be honoured as the <strong>‘Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society’</strong>.</li>
				<li>In 1986, she was awarded the <strong>‘Defense Distinguished Service Medal’</strong>.</li>
				<li>In 1991, she was awarded the <strong>‘National Medal of Technology’</strong>. She was the first woman recipient of this honour.</li>

			<h2>Quotes:</h2>
			<div class="quotes">
			<p>"[The Computer] was the first machine man built that assisted the power of his brain instead of the strength of his arm."</p>
			<p>"Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, "We've always done it this way." I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counter-clockwise."</p>
			<p>"At present, we're putting on paper a lot of stuff that never needed to be on paper. We do need to keep the records. But there isn't any reason for printing them. The next generation growing up with the computers will change that."</p>
			<p>"If it's a good idea, go ahead and do it. It is much easier to apologize than it is to get permission."</p>
